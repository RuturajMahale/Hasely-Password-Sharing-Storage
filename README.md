# Hasely 
## Credential Storage & Sharing App

Hasely is designed to be your one stop solution for hasel free Storage, Security & Sharing.
Designed to be simple, fast & secure, Hasely shares a comfortable & bold UI with minimal User Experience.
As security was our number one priority while designing Hasely, it utilises various security 
features such as Fingerprint Authentication, FaceID, PIN Authentication & Two Factor Authentication in-build to your device.

## Process
### Understanding The Assignment 

While designing a Credential Storage & Sharing platform, we needed to 
understand the needs & necessity for the user. Taking important 
features as well as user emotions into consideration, a road map sketch 
was made to understand the user path & time spent on each page.

### Case Studies

We studied various existing Credential storage apps to understand their path & User Experience,
we took down various notes about the UI as well as the theme for each app.

### Sketching & Ideation 

Now was the time to take the white board & start sketching paths, pages, UI buttons,
headers, body & covering every major & minor scale features. 

### Figma Low-Fidelity

All of the work done above was translated into Low-Fidelity Mockups on 
Figma, a all-in-one app for UI / UX Designers which gives the designer the power 
to think, test & finalize via digital sketching. We made Low-Fidelity
mockups of every page in the app showing the scale & placement of everything
within the page.

### Wireframing & User Testing 

These Low-Fidelity Mockup pages were connected via wireframes &
then the app was taken to 5 users, taking notes about their experience
& emotions on every page & every aspect of a perticular page.

### Revision & High-Fidelity 

After revision, we jumped on the High-Fidelity Mockups, designing everything 
from the smallest buttons to entire body layouts & color palette. 
Taking several options to our users for testing we picked the most loved one & 
gave it some finishing touches.

### Prototyping

This was the last stage of our design "Hasely" a one-stop hasel free experience
for security, storage & sharing. We connected the final pages & made them 
interactive, compiling everything to the links below. 

## Time to Roll
We hope that you experience our High Fidelity Prototype yourself. 

Suggestions and appreciations are always welcome. Thank you :)
